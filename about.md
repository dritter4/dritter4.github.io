I'm an early career transportation planner with a passion for using spatial and non-spatial data to gain insights into how we move. I recently graduated from the University of Utah with my master's degree in city planning and I work for Foursquare ITP in Washington, D.C. as a transportation planner. I'm particularly interested in the spatial aspects of transportation systems and using data for mapping, analysis, and modeling.

I have experience in the following tools:
* Spatial: ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, Google Earth Pro
* Analytical: R, SQL, Python, Microsoft Excel
* Travel Modeling: Synchro (basic), Cube (basic)
* Visualization: Adobe Illustrator, PowerBI
* Other: Qualtrics, Microsoft Office Suite

### Why this site?

Simply put, I’m trying to push my professional knowledge and technical expertise forward through a range of personal and academic projects. I want to share what I create – not just the finished product, but the conceptual and technical side as well.
