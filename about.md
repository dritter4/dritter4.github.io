I’m pursuing my master’s degree in city planning at the University of Utah with a focus on transportation planning. I joined the U as a graduate fellow with the Global Change & Sustainability Center and am working with Dr. Andy Hong to study the economic and health impacts of recreational bicycling in Utah.

I’m especially excited about long-range transportation planning, multimodal travel, and spatial aspects of transportation systems. I’m interested in spatial and non-spatial data analysis, transportation modeling, and monitoring and evaluation.

I have experience in the following tools:
* Spatial: QGIS, ArcGIS
* Analytical: R, Excel, SQL
* Travel Modeling: Synchro, Cube
* Visualization: ArcGIS StoryMaps, PowerBI, Adobe Illustrator
* Other: Qualtrics, Microsoft Office Suite


### Why this site?

Simply put, I’m trying to push my professional knowledge and technical expertise forward through a range of personal and academic projects. I want to share what I create – not just the finished product, but the conceptual and technical side as well.
