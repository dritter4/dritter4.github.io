I’m currently pursuing a master’s degree in city planning at the University of Utah with a focus on transportation planning. I joined the U as a graduate fellow with the Global Change & Sustainability Center and have been working with Dr. Andy Hong to study the economic and health impacts of recreational cycling. 

I’m especially excited about long-range transportation planning, multimodal transportation, and spatial aspects of transportation systems. Additionally, I’m interested in spatial and non-spatial data analysis, transportation modeling, and monitoring and evaluation. 

### Why this site?

Simply put, I’m trying to push my knowledge and technical expertise forward through a range of personal and academic projects. I want to share what I create – not just the finished product, but the conceptual and technical side as well. Even the creation of this site has been a learning experience as I teach myself basic programming. I’m not sure where this will go after the first post or two, but that’s the exciting part.
