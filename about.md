I’m pursuing my master’s degree in city planning at the University of Utah with a focus on transportation planning. I joined the U as a graduate fellow with the Global Change & Sustainability Center and am working with Dr. Andy Hong through the [Healthy Aging & Resilient Places Lab](https://www.harp.utah.edu/) to study the relationship between pedestrian falls and the built environment. Additionally, I serve as vice president of [University of Utah Urbanists](https://www.instagram.com/uofuurbanists/), an APA-registered planning student organization.

I’m especially excited about long-range transportation planning, multimodal travel, and spatial aspects of transportation systems. I’m interested in spatial and non-spatial data analysis, transportation modeling, and monitoring and evaluation.

I have experience in the following tools:
* Spatial: ArcGIS Pro, ArcPy, QGIS, Google Earth Pro
* Analytical: R, Python, Excel, SQL
* Travel Modeling: Synchro (basic), Cube (basic)
* Visualization: PowerBI, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign (basic)
* Other: Qualtrics, Microsoft Office Suite

### Why this site?

Simply put, I’m trying to push my professional knowledge and technical expertise forward through a range of personal and academic projects. I want to share what I create – not just the finished product, but the conceptual and technical side as well.
